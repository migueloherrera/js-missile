Project: Using Canvas to Build Games in the Browser

Build Missile Command in an HTML5 Canvas.

The first level starts with 12 enemy missiles falling from the sky and increases by 4 each level. It also starts with 15 missiles to destroy the enemy missiles and increases by 2 each level.

If the bases are destroyed, you won't be able to shoot missiles.

Cities and bases are renewed every time you go to the next level.

Have fun!
